# Gijs - Personal reflection

## Contributions
My main role in the development process was programming.
### Design
In the first lecture when creating groups I showed my interest in creating a non-euclidean VR game in the Discord text channel. Anar and Inger quickly followed up in sharing this interest, after that the design process started and as I had the most technical experience with using portals in VR that is where most of my contribution to the design stopped. The only other design feature that was my idea was the pole in the middle of the room to use as a way to progress towards the next level.

### Technical
Technical contributions:
- Adding PocketPortalVR and updating it to the latest version of OpenVR and OpenXR
- Creating frameless portal planes and fixing render issues introduced by frameless portals
- Framework for level progression using triggers
- Supporting tracking for controllers through dimensions
- Fixing render issues introduced by dimension tracked controllers
- QA testing the added levels

## PMI
### Plus
- I always wanted to do something with non-euclidean in VR after watching Code Parade's video.
- I think collaborating with the other team members went great, we checked in with eachother frequently.

### Min
- I did not contribute a whole lot to the design process, which I did not mind. However, it is the main goal of the minor to design.
- I am somewhat disappointed in the polish of the eventual product as there were a lot of technical goals that had priority.

### Interesting
- I would love to work on this project in the future.
- I learned a whole lot about the inner workings of PocketPortalVR and portals in general.
