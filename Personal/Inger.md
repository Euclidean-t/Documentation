# Inger - Personal reflection

## Contributions
My primary role in the process was helping design puzzles and then translating them into playable levels. I also worked on the tracking of controllers through dimensions. Lastly, I created the interactable buttons.

### Design
- Translating puzzle concepts into levels that would work with the tech we had
- The layout of each puzzle and their components

### Technical
- Setting up a GitHub repo containing a Unity project with SteamVR working
- Building the levels in Unity
- Creating interactable buttons
- Supporting tracking for controllers through dimensions

## PMI
### Plus
- We managed to create a good prototype, with multiple levels, given the little time we had
- I learned a lot about creating for VR

### Minus
- My headset decided to give out halfway through the project, leaving only one of us able to test on the fly
- I would have liked to playtest with people outside our team

### Interesting
- What is clear and understandable to may not be to everyone
- This was the first time since coming to the HKU that I wasn't (co)lead programmer
